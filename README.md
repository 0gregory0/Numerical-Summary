# Numerical-Summary
I was learning about modules in Python, and Statistics in class, and what better way to learn than to do?
[ProbStatipy](https://github.com/0gregory0/ProbStatipy) is a package of Python modules equipped with functions that are used in Statistics.
I am aware that such a package already exists by the name [Statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) and I'm doing this entirely for learning purposes. In this repo, and the package, I create functions to compute:

1. Measures of Central Tendency
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
2. Measures of Dispersion / Spread
   - Variance
   - Standard Deviation
   - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
   - Range
   - Quartiles, Deciles and Percentiles
