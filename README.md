# Probstatipy Notebooks
[ProbStatipy](https://github.com/0gregory0/ProbStatipy) is a package of Python modules equipped with functions that are used in Statistics.
In this repo, and the package, I create functions and classes to compute:

1. Measures of Central Tendency
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
  
2. Measures of Dispersion / Spread
   - Variance
   - Standard Deviation
   - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
   - Range
   - Quartiles, Deciles and Percentiles
  
3. Probabilities
