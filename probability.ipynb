    "A **random experiment** is any activity, procedure or process that may lead to more than one outcome with uncertainty as to which outcome will occur. Examples of random experiments include rolling a die or tossing a coin. You can't tell for sure which outcome will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sample space** is a set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For example the sample space, denoted by **S**, of rolling a die is:\n",
    "\n",
    "S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "A  **Basic Outcome** refers to a single element in the sample space. One such basic outcome from rolling a die may be 4. Other basic outcomes include 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Event**, often denoted by a capital letter such as E, A, B etc, is a subset of the sample space that contains a basic outcome or a set of basic outcomes that we're interested in. For example, when rolling a die, you may be interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The event that it is a 4:\n",
    "    - A = {4}\n",
    "\n",
    "- The event that it is an odd number:\n",
    "    - B = {1, 3, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **probability** is the measure of chance of the occurence of an event during a random experiment"
